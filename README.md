# k-Means Clustering Tutorial

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the k-Means clustering algorithm using the **Mall Customers Dataset**. It covers theoretical concepts, practical implementation, and visualization of clustering results.

## Project Overview

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on their similarity. This tutorial demonstrates how to:
- Apply k-Means clustering to segment customers.
- Visualize clusters and centroids.
- Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Dataset Information

The dataset contains 200 customer entries with the following features:
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Customers' yearly income in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending patterns.

The dataset can also be downloaded directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdraiesh9648/mall-customers-dataset).
